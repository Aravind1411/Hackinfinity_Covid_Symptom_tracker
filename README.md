# Hackinfinity_Covid_Symptom_tracker
The end-to-end system developed is an  user input based Web application. It
takes the input from the user for their details and shows a list of symptoms which
they may be experiencing. On the basis of their entered choices the received
input will be processed and their probability will be shown to them. If the
probability is severe or high, then the person is prompted to consult a doctor. A Machine Learning
Model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the
infection.The trained machine learning model is then converted to a pickle file
and with the help of FLASK, frontend using HTML,CSS and backend using
Python is designed.The created web application is finally deployed using the
HEROKU platform
